h1. Will Paginate Liquidized

h2. About

A small plugin allowing you to use pagination from "will_paginate":http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate inside your "Liquid":http://github.com/tobi/liquid/tree/master templates. This is a new version of the "older plugin":http://www.artweb-design.de/projects/ruby-on-rails-plugin-will_paginate-liquidized at artweb-design.  I've basically re-written parts of it to work with the very latest versions of Liquid and Will-Paginate (see below for the version information). I will try to keep this plugin up to date with ongoing changes in the Liquid and Will-Paginate projects.  Check the latest commit logs and this doc for more information.
